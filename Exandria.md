The events of [Exandria Unlimited: Calamity] and those recounted in [Downfall] take place late in the second age, the events of [Exandria Unlimited: Divergence] take place at the transition to the third age, and the events of [Critical Role] through the end of [Campaign Three] take place in the final decades of the third age. For a timeline of Exandrian history as it is now known, with dates, see the article [Timeline].
